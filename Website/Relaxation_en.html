          <p>
            Snacking can help you focus on your study instead of your next meal
            or the candy machine across the hallway. Some good options are nuts
            or seeds for mental clarity. Dark chocolate can also help with
            concentration and mood.

          <h2>Stare out the window</h2>
          <p>
            If you're stuck, sometimes it helps to just stare out the window.
            It’s a way to better grasp the contents of your own thoughts and can
            give a new perspective on what you were stuck with.

          <h2>Yoga</h2>
          <p>
            Sitting in the same position for a long time can get uncomfortable.
            It's a good idea to do a few stretch exercises for your neck,
            shoulders, and back.

          <h2>Walking</h2>
          <p>
            Walking helps reduce stress and depressive feelings. It's a great
            way to clear your mind and organize your thoughts. Anxiety symptoms
            often decrease significantly with regular walks. So try a short walk
            of 15–30 minutes.

          <h2>A bath & warm shower</h2>
          <p>
            Warm water helps you relax, which is especially nice if you have
            stiff muscles. It improves circulation and can relieve pain, like
            menstrual cramps or headaches. It also opens your pores and washes
            away dead skin cells and impurities.

          <h2>Hobby</h2>
          <p>
            One of the biggest benefits of hobbies is stress relief. When we do
            activities we enjoy, it helps us relax. It doesn’t have to be
            intense—reading, drawing, or being creative all count.

          <h2>Spending time with family/friends</h2>
          <p>
            During busy periods, students often spend less time with the people
            who matter most. Still, it's important to make time for that.
            Spending real quality time with your loved ones helps you feel more
            connected and confident. It also reassures the people who care about
            you.
